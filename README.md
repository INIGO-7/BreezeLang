# BreezeLang üå¨Ô∏èüå¨Ô∏è

**Welcome to BreezeLang!**

BreezeLang is a programming language inspired by the features I cherish most from the diverse languages I‚Äôve used. It‚Äôs designed to blend practicality, simplicity, and elegance, making programming both efficient and enjoyable.

### Features
- A curated mix of the best features from popular programming languages.
- Ongoing development to introduce unique and user-friendly capabilities.

### Current Status
BreezeLang is in its early stages of development, and new features are being actively added.

It is my final project proposal for the "Compiler Construction" course at [OTH REGENSBURG](https://www.oth-regensburg.de/en/)

### Getting Started
To try out BreezeLang:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/INIGO-7/BreezeLang.git
   $ cd BreezeLang
   ```
2. Usage:
  - First install the dependencies (gcc, make, bison, flex)
    ```bash
    $ sudo apt-get install gcc make bison flex
    ```
  - Execute the following to compile the whole project 
    ```bash
    $ make
    ```
  - Then run
    ```bash
    $ ./coolcompiler
    ```
    To start writing in REPL mode
    OR
    
    ```bash
    $ ./coolcompiler < some_file.bl
    ```
    To evaluate the whole file.
